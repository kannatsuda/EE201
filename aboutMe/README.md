# About Me
I am a sohomore at the University of Washington majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I took Professor Eley's EE 280 class last quarter and I am excited to take her class again this quarter. Outside of my academic activities, I am a member of the Husky Robotics and an officer of the Japanese Student Association.
